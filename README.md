# Reinforcement Learning Workshop by MathWorks

## Overview
Welcome to the official repository for the Reinforcement Learning Workshop hosted by MathWorks. This workshop was designed to introduce participants to the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning (RL) and the workflows essential for developing robust RL applications. It was facilitated by a MathWorks engineer specializing in reinforcement learning.

## Contents
This repository contains:
- **Presentation Slides:** Overview of reinforcement learning concepts, applications, and best practices.
- **MATLAB Project:** A sequence of exercises that guide you through the typical RL workflow, demonstrating how to utilize specific tools at each stage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- Understand the key concepts and techniques in reinforcement learning.
- Be familiar with the workflows involved in developing reinforcement learning applications.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing RL algorithms using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have:
- Basic knowledge of MATLAB.
- An understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.

## Installation
To get started with the exercises, clone this repository and double click on the .mlproj file from within MATLAB. This will "unzip" the workshop files to the folder you select when prompted. Ensure you have the latest version of MATLAB installed, along with the necessary toolboxes mentioned in the project requirements.

## Usage
Follow the instructions in each exercise within the MATLAB project to learn step-by-step. The exercises are structured to build your understanding progressively and apply your knowledge in practical scenarios.

The repository also contains solutions to the exercises in the "solutions" folder.
